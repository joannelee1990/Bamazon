# BAMAZON

### Details on the assignment
This is the creation of an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

### Why make this?
The project is useful because it shows how databases (mySQL) are used in conjunction with node.js along with npm packages. It is the first step into back-end software development. 

### How you create the webpage

First use my mySQL to create a new database, add data, connect the database to the js page through node.js, and use the command line to replicate the Amazon-like storefront to the user. 

## Technologies used

* node.js

* MySQL

* npm packages: inquirer, mysql, console.table

### Ending Notes

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, the Firebase website which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (Google Fu!) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself!
